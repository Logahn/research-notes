Supervised learning makes a rule from exprience and uses this rule to make predictions
Labeled data are the results of an experuence. 

Unsupervised learning is without experience and label and the machine dedcides to classify based on the similarities between data.

Training distribution should comensurate testing distribution
You cannot use the experience of world champions to train a model for elementary school kids


All machine algorithms can be boiled down to finding the optimal weights for the model
