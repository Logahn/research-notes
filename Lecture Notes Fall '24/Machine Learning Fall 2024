Machine Learning Fall 2024

Machine Learning is a computer learn from experience E
with respect to a specific task T
and a specific problem P
if its performance on T measured by P improves with E

Supervised learning makes a rule from experience and uses this rule to make predictions
Labeled data are the results of an experience. 

Unsupervised learning is without experience and label and the machine decides to classify based on the similarities between data.

Surface and Deep Learning

Training distribution should commensurate testing distribution
You cannot use the experience of world champions to train a model for elementary school kids


All machine algorithms can be boiled down to finding the optimal weights for the model


Step size

Concept learning

Concept learning is like trying to describe the world to the computer
Consider concept learning like simulating the learning process of a baby in a machine.
