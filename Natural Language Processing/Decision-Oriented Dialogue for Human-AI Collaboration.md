## Tasks: 

1. Propose an alternative title.
2. Discuss a missing experiment from the paper.
3. Submit a question about the paper.
4. What social or other impacts were overlooked or omitted?



**Alternative title:** The Role of AI in Dialogue-Based Collaboration


**Missing Experiments from the paper:**
- While the paper discusses simulated environments, it does not include any experiments in real-world settings. 
- Although, the paper is focused on Human-AI Intreaction, evaluating its effectiveness against other AI frameworks might have shed more light on strengths and weaknesses.

**Question About the Paper:**
- Why does the paper focus narrowly on only three decision oriented dialogues?

**Social and Other Impacts overlooked:** 
- The paper overlooks the fact that the dialogues collected for analysis may be subject to biases based on the specific contexts in which they were gathered.
