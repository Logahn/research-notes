# Rehersal: Simulating Conflict to Teach Conflict Resolution

## Tasks: 

1. Propose an alternative title.
2. Discuss a missing experiment from the paper.
3. Submit a question about the paper.
4. What social or other impacts were overlooked or omitted?



**Alternative title:** REHEARSAL: Learning Comflict Resolution through Feedback


**Missing Experiments from the paper:**
- The paper didn't have any experiments on how individual factors, such as personality traits or prior experience with conflict, influence the effectiveness of the simulations.

**Question About the Paper:**
- The N = 40 participantes in the evaluation represent a very specific niche of people. Why was a larger and more diverse group of individuals used?
- Languages sometimes adds to aggressive behaviours as some languages sound more aggressive than others. How can the work accommodate the aggressive behaviour that may result from the structure of other languages?

**Social and Other Impacts overlooked:** 
- The work completely overlooks the resolution of conflict among minors.
